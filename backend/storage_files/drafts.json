    "body": "Subject: Re: Your weekly development newsletter (Week of Nov 8, 2025)\n\nHi there  ,\n\nThanks for sending over the latest weekly development newsletter! The topics look really interesting, especially the 'Performance tips for React Server Components' and the 'deep-dive tutorial on WebAssembly in 2025'. I'm looking forward to diving into those.\n\nJust a quick heads-up – I noticed the date on this edition is for the 'Week of Nov 8, 2025.' Is this an advanced preview, or perhaps a typo in the year?\n\nThanks again for the valuable content!\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]",
